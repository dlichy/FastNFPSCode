8.  GENERAL
8.1  We may transfer our rights and obligations under this Agreement to another organisation. You may only assign or transfer your rights or obligations under this Agreement if we agree in writing.

8.2  This Agreement does not give rise to any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this Agreement.
 
8.3  Each of the clauses in this Agreement operate separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them (in whole or in part) are unlawful, the remaining clauses, or part-clauses, will remain in full force and effect.
 
8.4  If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under this Agreement, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this Agreement, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.

8.5 This Agreement is the entire agreement between us in relation to its subject matter. You acknowledge that you have not relied on any statement, promise or representation or assurance or warranty that is not set out in this Agreement.

8.6 Both parties agree that direct monetary damages may not be the sole extent of damages related to a breach of this Agreement. Each party therefore agrees a breach of this Agreement by you will allow us to seek additional relief from you.

8.7 This Agreement is governed by English law. The courts of England shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim that arises out of or in connection with this Agreement, however we are entitled to apply to any court worldwide for injunctive or other remedies in order to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights in the Work and Documentation.
